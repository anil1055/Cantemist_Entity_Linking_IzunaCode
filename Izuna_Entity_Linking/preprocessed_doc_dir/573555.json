    "abst": "Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, has found an important position in the practice of medicine. Its use in pregnancy, however, is an open question as a number of detrimental side effects have been reported in the fetus and neonate. Ten patients and 12 pregnancies are reported where chronic propranolol has been administered. Five patients with serial pregnancies with and without propranolol therapy are also examined. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications are examined. An attempt is made to differentiate drug-related complications from maternal disease--related complications. We conclude that previously reported hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, neonatal apnea, and bradycardia are not invariable and cannot be statistically correlated with chronic propranolol therapy. Growth retardation, however, appears to be significant in both of our series.",
