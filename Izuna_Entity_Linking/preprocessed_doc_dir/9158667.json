We report a case of acute renal failure in an APL patient treated with ATRA alone. This case further supports the concern about thromboembolic complications associated with ATRA therapy in APL patients. The patients, a 43-year-old man, presented all the signs and symptoms of APL and was included in a treatment protocol with ATRA. After 10 days of treatment, he developed acute renal failure that was completely reversible after complete remission of APL was achieved and therapy discontinued. We conclude that ATRA is a valid therapeutic choice for patients with APL, although the procoagulant tendency is not completely corrected. Thrombotic events, however, could be avoided by using low-dose heparin.",
