    "abst": "The authors describe the case of a 56-year-old woman with chronic, severe heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy and absence of significant ventricular arrhythmias who developed QT prolongation and torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia during one cycle of intermittent low dose (2.5 mcg/kg per min) dobutamine. This report of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia during intermittent dobutamine supports the hypothesis that unpredictable fatal arrhythmias may occur even with low doses and in patients with no history of significant rhythm disturbances. The mechanisms of proarrhythmic effects of Dubutamine are discussed.",
