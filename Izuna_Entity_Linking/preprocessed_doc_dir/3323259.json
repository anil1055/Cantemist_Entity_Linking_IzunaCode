    "title": "Differential effects of 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: therapeutic implications.",
    "abst": "Increasing recognition of the importance of calcium in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has stimulated research into the use of calcium channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic modalities. Clinical applications of calcium channel blockers parallel their tissue selectivity. In contrast to verapamil and diltiazem, which are roughly equipotent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue. As the first dihydropyridine available for use in the United States, nifedipine controls angina and hypertension with minimal depression of cardiac function. Additional members of this group of calcium channel blockers have been studied for a variety of indications for which they may offer advantages over current therapy. Once or twice daily dosage possible with nitrendipine and nisoldipine offers a convenient administration schedule, which encourages patient compliance in long-term therapy of hypertension. The coronary vasodilating properties of nisoldipine have led to the investigation of this agent for use in angina. Selectivity for the cerebrovascular bed makes nimodipine potentially useful in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage, migraine headache, dementia, and stroke. In general, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are usually well tolerated, with headache, facial flushing, palpitations, edema, nausea, anorexia, and dizziness being the more common adverse effects.",
