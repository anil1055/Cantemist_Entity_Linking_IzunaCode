    "title": "Chronic carbamazepine treatment in the rat: efficacy, toxicity, and effect on plasma and tissue folate concentrations.",
    "abst": "Folate depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a commonly used AED, has been implicated in some clinical studies. A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic CBZ treatment on folate concentrations in the rat. In the course of developing this model, a common vehicle, propylene glycol, by itself in high doses, was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight gain. Seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl ether (HFDE) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by CBZ than seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES). Oral administration of CBZ as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg/kg was continuously protective against HFDE-induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treatment. The CBZ levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals, however, were below those normally considered protective. This treatment with CBZ had no apparent adverse effect on folate concentrations in the rat, and, indeed, the folate concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment.",
