The study was performed on sexually mature male rats. Serum concentrations of prolactin (PRL) and testosterone (T) were measured. Tissue sections were evaluated with light and electron microscopy. Immunohistochemical reactions for Anti-Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) were performed. In rats of the experimental group, the mean concentration of: PRL was more than twice higher, whereas T concentration was almost twice lower than that in the control group. Light microscopy visualized the following: hypertrophy and epithelium hyperplasia of the glandular ducts, associated with increased PCNA expression. Electron microscopy revealed changes in columnar epithelial cells, concerning organelles, engaged in protein synthesis and secretion.",
