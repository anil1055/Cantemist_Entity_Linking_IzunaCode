    "abst": "Following unilateral 6-OHDA induced SN lesion, a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral circling. In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on amphetamine-induced rotational behavior. Three days post lesion, most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion. Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration-induced breakdown of the DA pool, or lesion-induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons. A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rotation. However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, amphetamine dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), amphetamine-induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections. These findings suggest that amphetamine has an irreversible effect on the post-lesion DA pool contributing to contralateral rotation.",
