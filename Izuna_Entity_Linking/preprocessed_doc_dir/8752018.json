    "abst": "BACKGROUND: Lithium remains a first-line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of lithium, such as polyuria and tremor, more subtle lithium side effects such as cognitive deficits, loss of creativity, and functional impairments remain understudied. This report summarizes our experience in switching bipolar patients from lithium to divalproex sodium to alleviate such cognitive and functional impairments. METHOD: Open, case series design. RESULTS: We report seven cases where substitution of lithium, either fully or partially, with divalproex sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive, motivational, or creative deficits attributed to lithium in our bipolar patients. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary report, divalproex sodium was a superior alternative to lithium in bipolar patients experiencing cognitive deficits, loss of creativity, and functional impairments.",
