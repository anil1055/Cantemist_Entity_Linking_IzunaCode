Each course was repeated monthly. 2 patients had stage II, 14 stage III and 22 stage IV disease. 14 of the 38 patients were previously treated with chemotherapy, 1 with radiation, 6 with both chemotherapy and radiation, and 17 did not have any treatment before CPDD combination. 31 of the 38 cases (81.5%) demonstrated objective responses lasting for 2 months or more. These responses were partial in 19 and complete in 12 cases. Hematologic toxicity was moderate and with reversible anemia developing in 71% of patients. Gastrointestinal side effects from CPDD were universal. HMM gastrointestinal toxicity necessitated discontinuation of the drug in 5 patients. Severe nephrotoxicity was observed in 2 patients but was reversible. There were no drug-related deaths.",
