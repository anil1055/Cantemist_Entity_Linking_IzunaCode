The sudden onset of respiratory distress, rash, and a history of a new medicine led the two paramedics on the scene to administer subcutaneous epinephrine. Subsequently, acute cardiac arrest and fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred. Epinephrine has a proven role in cardiac arrest in prehospital care; however, use by paramedics in patients with suspected allergic reaction and severe hypertension should be viewed with caution.",
