    "abst": "The objective of this study was to determine whether ephedrine, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist previously shown to enhance genital blood flow in women, has beneficial effects in reversing antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction. Nineteen sexually dysfunctional women receiving either fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine participated in an eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of the effects of ephedrine (50 mg) on self-report measures of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction. Although there were significant improvements relative to baseline in sexual desire and orgasm intensity/pleasure on 50 mg ephedrine 1-hr prior to sexual activity, significant improvements in these measures, as well as in sexual arousal and orgasmic ability also were noted with placebo. These findings highlight the importance of conducting placebo-controlled trials for this condition.",
