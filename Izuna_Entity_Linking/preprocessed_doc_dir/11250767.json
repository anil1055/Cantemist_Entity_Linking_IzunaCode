    "abst": "OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of propylthiouracil-induced vasculitis manifesting with pericarditis. METHODS: We present the first case report of a woman with hyperthyroidism treated with propylthiouracil in whom a syndrome of pericarditis, fever, and glomerulonephritis developed. Serologic testing and immunologic studies were done, and a pericardial biopsy was performed. RESULTS: A 25-year-old woman with Graves' disease had a febrile illness and evidence of pericarditis, which was confirmed by biopsy. Serologic evaluation revealed the presence of perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (pANCA) against myeloperoxidase (MPO). Propylthiouracil therapy was withdrawn, and she was treated with a 1-month course of prednisone, which alleviated her symptoms. A literature review revealed no prior reports of pericarditis in anti-MPO pANCA-positive vasculitis associated with propylthio- uracil therapy. CONCLUSION: Pericarditis may be the initial manifestation of drug-induced vasculitis attributable to propylthio- uracil therapy.",
