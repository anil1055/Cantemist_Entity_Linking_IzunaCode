    "abst": "To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels, catecholamines, and psychotic symptoms, nineteen patients in a psychiatric emergency service with a diagnosis of amphetamine- or cocaine-induced psychosis were interviewed, and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and catecholamine metabolite levels. Methamphetamine or amphetamine levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global hyperkinesia rating. HVA levels were related to global hyperkinesia but not to psychopathology ratings. Although many other factors such as sensitization may play a role, intensity of stimulant-induced psychotic symptoms and stereotypies appears to be at least in part dose-related.",
